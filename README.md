# ATA.JS Javascript Life Cycle System

## Overview

ata.js is a Node.js-based module that enables the creation and management of complex project structures with modular components, executing tasks within a root and restricted context. This system allows developers to easily initiate, configure, and execute projects in a highly modular and efficient way, leveraging a flexible core system.

The architecture is designed to support different project "modes" and component-based loading, providing a robust environment where different parts of the system are modular and can depend on each other.

## Features

- **Modular Components**: The system is organized into various modules such as App, Controller, Config, Core, Service, DB, and others.
- **Project Modes**: Projects are initialized with an environment variable defining the mode (default: "Run").
- **Component Hierarchy**: Modules are loaded and initialized in a hierarchical structure. Each module can expose its own functions, and depending on the mode, they can be initialized or configured differently.
- **Root and Restricted Access**: Certain modules like Controller have root-level access, allowing them to execute commands freely. Other modules like Service have restricted access, with the capability to use only certain functions exposed by higher-level modules.
- **Promise-based Execution**: Each module can handle asynchronous tasks using promises, providing a way to manage success (OK(…)) and failure (NO(…)) outcomes.

## Installation And Usage

To install and use ata.js, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g ata.js
```

### Create A Project

```bash
npx ata.init
```

This will initialize the project and set up the necessary configuration files.
During the initialization process, you will be prompted to enter the project and a few other details.

## An Example Project Structure

Once initialized, your project will follow a modular structure. The base project will look like the following:

```mathematica
an-example-project/
 ├── App/
 ├── Config/
 ├── Constant/
 ├── Controller/
 ├── Core/
 ├── DataBase/
 ├── Document/
 ├── Extension/
 ├── InterFace/
 ├── Job/
 ├── Library/
 ├── Log/
 ├── Mod/
 ├── Service/
 └── Source/
```

Here are the main directories and their purposes (for details, click note links on each explanation):

- **Application**: Contains the core application logic. [details](https://github.com/Mustafaozver/ata.js/blob/main/Document/Application.md)
- **Config**: Holds configuration files and environment settings. [details](https://github.com/Mustafaozver/ata.js/blob/main/Document/Config.md)
- **Constant**: Stores constant values used throughout the application. [details](https://github.com/Mustafaozver/ata.js/blob/main/Document/Constant.md)
- **Controller**: Manages the logic for specific components, can have root access to the system. [details](https://github.com/Mustafaozver/ata.js/blob/main/Document/Controller.md)
- **Core**: The central system, including execution and multi-threading management. [details](https://github.com/Mustafaozver/ata.js/blob/main/Document/Core.md)
- **DataBase**: Database interactions and management. [details](https://github.com/Mustafaozver/ata.js/blob/main/Document/DataBase.md)
- **Document**: The documents are that we wrote and automatic generated by the system. [details](https://github.com/Mustafaozver/ata.js/blob/main/Document/Document.md)
- **Extension**: Additional functionality that can be added to the system. [details](https://github.com/Mustafaozver/ata.js/blob/main/Document/Extension.md)
- **Interface**: Holds the interfaces for communication between components. [details](https://github.com/Mustafaozver/ata.js/blob/main/Document/InterFace.md)
- **Job**: The starter script is used for each thread. [details](https://github.com/Mustafaozver/ata.js/blob/main/Document/Job.md)
- **Library**: Core utilities and shared resources. [details](https://github.com/Mustafaozver/ata.js/blob/main/Document/Library.md)
- **Log**: Logging system for keeping track of events and errors. [details](https://github.com/Mustafaozver/ata.js/blob/main/Document/Log.md)
- **Mod**: the files include system start settings for running mod. [details](https://github.com/Mustafaozver/ata.js/blob/main/Document/Mod.md)
- **Service**: Provides additional services, often used for external computations or handling specific logic. [details](https://github.com/Mustafaozver/ata.js/blob/main/Document/Service.md)
- **Source**: The source files of the project. [details](https://github.com/Mustafaozver/ata.js/blob/main/Document/Source.md)

## Commands

### Initialization

```bash
npx ata.init
```

This command will initialize a new project and set up the necessary modules.

### Run The Project

```bash
npx ata.run
```

This command starts the project on the current folder with the configuration defined during initialization.

### Test The Project

```bash
npx ata.test
```

Run this command to execute tests and verify that everything is functioning as expected.

### Run The Project On Electron

```bash
npx ata.electron
```

Launch the Electron-based UI for the project (if applicable). This command starts the project on the current folder with the configuration with electron support defined during initialization.

## Developing

```javascript
// Example Controller

Setup(()=>{
	// executed once immidiately
    const core = Project.Core.Add("THREAD-" + index, { // calling a core thread
	    Name: "THREAD1",
	    Commands: ["node"],
	    Environment: { index:1 }
	});

	core.Execute(); // run the thread


});

Loop(()=>{
	// cycles every second
});

const Name = "Example";
const Fonk = ()=>{
	//...
};

if(Name === Module.Name /*"Example"*/) OK("Correct"); // make ready the module
else NO("Name Definition Error");

return{
	Name: Name,
	Fonk: Fonk
};

```

## Project Flow

- **Initialization**: The project is first initialized using the `ata.init` command, which configures the base structure.
- **Modular Loading**: Based on the specified mode, the relevant modules are loaded in a hierarchical manner.
- **Execution**: Modules interact with each other via the core system, and asynchronous tasks are handled with promises.
- **Root and Restricted Access**: Modules like **Controller** can execute commands with full access, while modules like **Service** are restricted in terms of what they can do.
